    "# Website Content Extraction and Brochure Generation with LLaMA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to extract useful information from a company website and generate a professional brochure using the power of LLaMA language models. The process involves multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Website Scraping:** \n",
    "   - The `Website` class retrieves and processes content from a specified URL.\n",
    "   - The page title and textual content are extracted, while unnecessary elements like images and scripts are removed.\n",
    "   - The links found on the page are collected and processed to form a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contact Information Extraction:**\n",
    "   - Using regular expressions, phone numbers and email addresses are extracted from the website's textual content.\n",
    "   - This information is returned as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Link Classification for Brochure Content:**\n",
    "   - A prompt is sent to an LLaMA model to classify and filter the links found on the website.\n",
    "   - The model identifies important links such as \"About Us\", \"Mission\", \"Contact\", and \"Careers\" pages, which are critical for building a company brochure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Brochure Content Generation:**\n",
    "   - Based on the website summary and extracted contact information, an AI-generated brochure is created.\n",
    "   - The model writes sections like \"About Us\", \"Vision/Mission\", and \"Contact\" using the retrieved content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **Link Classification:** Helps extract relevant sections of the website that are crucial for creating a company brochure.\n",
    "- **Contact Information Extraction:** Retrieves phone numbers and emails from the website content, providing a fallback for incomplete data.\n",
    "- **Automated Brochure Generation:** AI-driven creation of professional brochure content from the website’s textual summary and contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the **Ollama** API with the LLaMA language model to process the content and generate human-like text based on the provided system instructions.\n"
